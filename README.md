# Port Scanner Bash Script

This is a simple Bash script for port scanning. It scans a specified range of ports on a given IP address to identify open ports. The script uses `nc` (Netcat) for port checking.

## Features

- Scans a specified range of ports on a given IP address.
- Reports open ports.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Requirements

- **Netcat (nc)**: Make sure `nc` is installed on your system.

### Installing Netcat

You can install Netcat with the following commands:


# On Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y netcat
```

# On CentOS/RHEL
```bash
sudo yum install -y nc
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x port_scanner.sh
```
3. Run the script with the following syntax:
```bash
./port_scanner.sh <IP_ADDRESS> <START_PORT> <END_PORT>
```
- IP_ADDRESS: The target IP address to scan.
- START_PORT: The starting port number for the scan range.
- END_PORT: The ending port number for the scan range.

## Example
To scan ports 20 through 80 on IP address 192.168.1.1, run:
```bash
./port_scanner.sh 192.168.1.1 20 80
```

## Sample Output
```bash
Scanning ports from 20 to 80 on 192.168.1.1...
Port 22 is open
Port 80 is open
Scan complete.
```
